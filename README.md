# Install Arch
My desktop and raspberry pi are using Arch Linux. If you want to do the same go take a look at the [installation guide](https://github.com/pascal-canuel/comfyArch) I made.

# Docker
Because my development environment (Desktop) and production (Pi) are on Arch you can
install it on both with the same command! `pacman -S docker` So easy!
Docker is awesome because, all the dependencies are going to be contain in the image.
I will only pull the image and run.
